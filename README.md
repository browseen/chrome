Compared to a paid alternative, an open-source browser automation tool eliminates the need to purchase expensive subscriptions or licenses. You can access the source code, making it possible to modify and customize a tool's functionality to your liking. However, there is a catch!

Even though an open-source web automation tool may eliminate the risk of vendor lock-in, it is built and maintained by different communities with different goals. So, selecting one for automated testing, website monitoring, bot development, form submission, or web scraping may be challenging.

Worry less because selecting a suitable open-source tool for web browser automation is about to get way more manageable. Here are:
7 Best Open Source Tools for Web Browser Automation
TestCafe

If you desire a web browser automation tool to test a web application integrated into a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline, TestCafe is your go-to tool. It is an open-source tool designed for end-to-end testing of web applications, ensuring they function properly across all core browsers, including Edge, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

Setting up TestCafe is straightforward, especially if you are a JavaScript or TypeScript veteran. It can operate without browser plugins, reducing complexity. Moreover, there is a vast and active community, plus documentation to reference in case you get stuck.
Puppeteer

Puppeteer excels at web scraping. You can also use it to test web application user interfaces and capture web page screenshots.

Regarding web scraping, Puppeteer can automate data collection from dynamic websites. You can set it up to navigate web pages, click on various elements, capture the desired data, and return it to you.

To mitigate web scraping hurdles like scaling up and anti-scraping measures, you can integrate Puppeteer with an automated browser for website unlocking and project scaling.

Thanks to its intuitive and straightforward API (Application Programming Interface), Puppeteer can generally be operated with minimal code. Its rich API provides a comprehensive set of functions for interacting with website pages, including screenshot generation, form filling and submission, PDF creation, and network interception.

Despite the rich API, Puppeteer's full potential can only be used within Chromium or Chrome. It does not natively support browsers like Firefox and Safari.
Cypress

How about a web browser automation tool for real-time testing? Yes, with Cypress, you can write tests and watch them run in real-time. This speeds up the debugging and development process, helping you catch issues and errors in time.

Besides real-time testing and debugging, you can use Cypress for UI (User Interface) testing to ensure the UI is intuitive and easy to navigate. You can also test applications' integration points to verify whether the components interact as expected.

Unlike Puppeteer, Cypress supports major browsers like Edge, Firefox, and Chrome. However, Cypress is also limited to Javascript and TypeScript, just like Puppeteer.

Advantageously, Cypress’ API comes with built-in commands for frequently used commands, reducing the need for you to write custom code as much.
Playwright

Need a browser automation tool for cross-browser testing? Then, Playwright is the tool for you. With Playwright, you can test a web app’s functionality across several browsers, including Safari, Firefox, and Chrome.

You can simulate user interactions, from simple navigation to complex workflows, to verify that a web application's components work consistently across various devices and browsers.

Besides being a robust tool for cross-browser and end-to-end testing, Playwright supports popular programming languages like C#, Python, TypeScript, and JavaScript. It has a modern API to simplify the setup process and clear documentation to simplify test creation and maintenance.
Selenium  

Some call it the de facto industry -standard web browser automation framework. Why? You can use Selenium for extensive web testing, including acceptance, functional, and regression testing.

If you want to test the reliability and quality of a web application, Selenium can help you cut the time required by half.

Apart from web application testing, you can use Selenium to scrape and submit forms. It has features to peruse through web pages, locate specified elements, and extract target data. Moreover, if you want to validate a form, test user registration, or form data entry, Selenium makes the whole automation process a breeze.

Despite all you can do with Selenium, note that it has a steep learning curve compared to the other automation tools. For example, to set up Selenium, you must configure browser dependencies and drivers, which can be overwhelming if you are a beginner.
Scrapy

Scrapy is widely used for website scraping. You can use it to extract data for content aggregation, competitor analysis, market research, and more. Its ability to scale allows you to build massive data sets through concurrent scraping. This means you can use it to scrape large-scale websites like E-commerce sites.

While Scrapy is powerful, its learning curve may be steep if you are not conversant with Python. Rather than operating at the browser level, Scrapy interacts directly with web servers, and you must understand how to set up scraping via HTTP requests.
Watir

Lastly, there is Watir, a Ruby library designed for web browser automation. Since it is exclusively developed for Ruby, you have to learn the ins and outs of Ruby.

In most cases, Watir is handy for web testing and script automation. You can use it to simulate user actions like filling out forms and clicking buttons to test the reliability and quality of a web app. Moreover, you can write automated web scraping scripts within Watir or scripts to help with repetitive tasks.

Adapting to Watir is pretty easy because it has a simple API. Ruby’s straightforward syntax makes writing automation scripts easy to learn. You can give it a shot if you want to start leveraging the power of Ruby libraries, frameworks, and tools.

Out of web browser automation tools comes the ability to automate web scraping, browser interactions, web application testing, and more. Running a business would be costly, and growth would be delayed if all these were done manually.

Now, with the help of this blog post, take your time to select a web automation tool based on your needs. Remember, there is support from the communities and contributors who are effortlessly working on these open-source tools for web browser automation.
